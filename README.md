# AstraStreaming SDK

AstraStreaming is a Kotlin + C++ streaming toolkit that delivers end-to-end AV capture, processing, encoding, FLV packaging, and RTMP uplink. The repository contains a demonstration Android app ("**AstraStream**") and a reusable library that powers hardware-accelerated live streaming pipelines.

## Key Capabilities

- Hardware-based audio and video encoding via `MediaCodec`
- Adaptive bitrate control at runtime
- Camera parameter tuning with front/back switching
- Safe camera bootstrapping with automatic fallback to 720p preview when a requested profile is unsupported
- Audio preprocessing (AEC/AGC) and capture configuration APIs
- OpenGL watermark composition and FBO based rendering
- FLV muxing and RTMP delivery backed by `librtmp`
- Orientation-aware preview with seamless live/preview transitions
- Session UI persists RTMP URL, encoder, resolution, and bitrate selections for quick relaunches
- Immersive, edge-to-edge preview with cutout support on full-screen devices
- RTMP + HTTP-FLV downstream address helper for quick playback verification
- Screen recording live mode combining microphone + playback capture with a Vulkan-based compositor, delivering MediaProjection frames without touching the camera pipeline, and an optional floating overlay when the app is backgrounded

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a clean architecture split:

- **UI Layer** â€“ `app/` demo (`LiveScreen`, `LiveSessionCoordinator`) and `widget/AVLiveView`
- **Use-Case Layer** â€“ `controller/*` orchestrating capture/encode/package/send
- **Device/Infrastructure** â€“ `camera/*`, `mediacodec/*`, `stream/*`, native `librtmp`

Core data-flow and component diagrams are authored in PlantUML with selective highlighting:

| Color | Layer | Components |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ðŸŸ¡ **Gold** | **Core Processing** | CameraRenderer, VideoEncoder, FLV Packer, RtmpPacker - Critical transformation logic |
| âš« **Dark Gray** | **Control Layer** | StreamController, AVLiveView, VideoController - Business coordination |
| â¬› **Gray Variants** | **Other Layers** | UI, Infrastructure, External systems - Supporting components |

The minimalist color scheme highlights only the most critical processing components, reducing visual noise while maintaining clear architectural boundaries.

### Audio/Video Data Flow

The end-to-end live pipeline is summarised in the PlantUML diagram below. It tracks a frame (and its paired PCM buffers) across capture, GPU processing, encoding, FLV packaging, and RTMP transmission.

![Audio/Video Data Flow](docs/generated/av_dataflow.png)

- **Source:** `docs/av_dataflow.puml`
- **Regenerate:** `./tools/render_docs.sh` (requires `plantuml` on PATH; emits assets into `docs/generated/` which remain untracked)
- **Highlights:** Camera frames flow through `GLSurfaceView` â†’ `CameraRenderer` (FBO + watermark) â†’ `VideoEncoder`; audio samples are captured and encoded in parallel, both converging inside the `StreamController` which multiplexes FLV and pushes via `RtmpSender`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Gradle 8.6 with Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.2 and Kotlin 1.9.24
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 34 (compile/target) with minimum API level 21
- Android NDK 27.1.12297006
- CMake 3.22.1

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sunlulu427/AstraStreaming.git
cd AstraStreaming

# assemble demo app & release AAR
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :library:assembleRelease
```

The demo Activity (`LiveActivity`) now renders a Material 3 Compose interface (`LiveScreen`) driven by a coordinator (`LiveSessionCoordinator`). It wires an `AVLiveView` into the Compose tree, applies default **720 Ã— 1280 @ 30fps** capture/stream settings, and exposes encoder selection, bitrate tuning, and live controls. Streaming is optionalâ€”users can leave the RTMP address empty to stay in preview-only modeâ€”and the entire experience runs in an immersive, edge-to-edge layout.

### Dual Live Modes

`LiveActivity` now mirrors Douyin-style parity between camera and screen capture. A segmented control lets creators switch between **Camera Live** (classic preview with `AVLiveView`) and **Screen Live** without leaving the activity. Screen mode keeps the Compose controls inlineâ€”publish URL, bitrate, microphone/playback toggles, stats visibility, and overlay permission promptsâ€”while showing projection readiness and stream metrics.

Screen live obtains MediaProjection consent on demand, mixes microphone + playback audio (`MixedAudioProcessor`), and renders frames with the Vulkan-backed `VulkanScreenRenderer`. When the host backgrounds the app, `ScreenOverlayManager` can surface a floating overlay (requires `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`) showing bitrate/fps and providing a one-tap return to the live console. Overlay enablement is optional and exposed in the screen live panel; the state syncs with the shared pipeline so bitrate/FPS updates continue while the overlay is visible.

## Stream URL Examples

The settings sheet exposes an optional **Publish URL** field. Provide an upstream RTMP address and the UI mirrors it into pull URLs (RTMP + HTTP-FLV) for instant playback verification. Example:

- Publish URL: `rtmp://47.100.16.213:1935/live/123333`
- Pull URL (RTMP): `rtmp://47.100.16.213:1935/live/123333`
- Pull URL (HTTP-FLV): `http://47.100.16.213:1935/live/123333.flv`

Notes:

- Publish and pull stream keys must match (`123333` in the example). The `.flv` suffix is only required by HTTP-FLV viewers.
- If the server exposes HTTP-FLV on a different port or path, adjust the generated value accordingly. The UI simply derives pull URLs from the publish address and keeps them in sync.
- Pull URLs live at the bottom of the scrollable settings list so they remain easy to copy after tuning other parameters.

## Live Session Lifecycle

`AVLiveView` bridges UI interactions to the streaming pipeline through the `LiveStreamSession` interface. The Compose-based demo wraps it with `AndroidView`, configuring capture and streaming parameters as soon as the view is available:

- `LiveSessionCoordinator` centralises all `AVLiveView` wiring:

```kotlin
AndroidView(
    factory = { context -> AVLiveView(context).also(coordinator::attachLiveView) },
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()
)

// Automatically retries with 720Ã—1280 if the requested profile is unsupported
LogHelper.i("LiveSessionCoordinator", "camera preview ready with 720x1280")
```

- Compose UI keeps the parameter sheet, stats overlay, and FAB states in sync with `LiveUiState`.
- Camera startup logs now surface the selected preview size and emit a warning when a fallback profile is applied, enabling quick diagnosis of device-specific limitations.
- The floating action button opens the RTMP dialog when no URL is set, so preview remains available even without streaming.
- Watermark text automatically scales with the configured capture resolution so branding stays legible across devices.

Typical runtime sequence:

1. Configure audio, video, and camera parameters (defaults to 720 Ã— 1280 @ 30 fps)
2. Configure the RTMP sender (native FLV/AMF muxing is handled in C++)
3. Call `startPreview()` to spin up the camera GL pipeline
4. Open the RTMP connection and invoke `startLive()`
5. Use `setVideoBps()` for adaptive bitrate, `setMute()` for audio mute
6. Stop via `live.stopLive()` and `sender.close()`

Watermarks can be queued before GL initializationâ€”`AVLiveView` applies them once the renderer is ready.

## Extensibility

Implement `LiveStreamSession` to swap streaming strategies (for example, a file recorder or alternate sender) without touching UI code:

```kotlin
class FileRecordingSession : LiveStreamSession { /* ... */ }

live.attachStreamSession(FileRecordingSession())
```

The interface exposes lifecycle hooks (`prepare`, `start`, `pause`, `resume`, `stop`) and configuration APIs, promoting dependency inversion and testability.

## Tooling & Diagnostics

- `tools/render_docs.sh`: generate diagram PNG/Markdown in `docs/generated/`
- `tools/diagnose_camera.sh [waitSeconds]`: automated ADB script for camera/GL troubleshooting (defaults to 8s delay before log capture and writes filtered output to `diagnostics/camera-startup-<timestamp>.log`)
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): builds the app/AAR and uploads rendered diagrams for every push/PR

Refer to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed development guidelines, Clean Architecture rules, and logging/diagnostic expectations.
